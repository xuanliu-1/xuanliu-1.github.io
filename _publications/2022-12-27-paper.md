title: "Exploring the heterogeneity in drivers of energy-saving behaviours among hotel guests: Insights from the theory of planned behaviour and personality profiles"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Abstract: Guest behaviour is important in driving hotel energy consumption, operating cost and environmental issues. Promoting energy-saving behaviours of guests is a promising strategy for the sustainable development of the hospitality industry. This research aims to explore the roles of personality profiles in individual heterogeneity in drivers of energy-saving behaviours among hotel guests. The study is based on a three-step research roadmap: First, we review existing literature on hotel energy-saving behaviour and intervention and construct an extended theory of planned behaviour model to explore the relationship between personality and energy-saving behaviours. Second, the research conducts a survey to identify the critical factors in the model and sets up four personality profiles for the respondents and compares the effects of critical factors upon respondents' energy-saving behaviours among different personality profile groups. Third, the study further conducts a follow-up survey on the subjective promoters and barriers of hotel energy-saving behaviours, where a descriptive analysis is employed to validate the findings. The findings reveal that personality profiles lead to varying effects of all critical factors in influencing the energy-saving behaviours of hotel guests. The research empirically demonstrates the important roles of personality profiles and household habits in shaping the energy behaviours of hotel guests and provides a novel view of understanding the heterogeneity of energy-saving behaviours in the hospitality industry. The study contributes to environmental behavioural theory by adding normative indicators and habit factors. Also, the study classifies the respondents into groups according to personality characteristics and demonstrates the significant role of personality. The research applies a follow-up study that can provide factual evidence to support the result of previous hypothetical testing. The findings provide valuable references to the development of tailored smart energy intervention measurements and management tools for hotel buildings.'
